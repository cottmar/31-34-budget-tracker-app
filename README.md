## Architecture and Scaffold
  This application uses webpack, which is a is a module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.

  Sass is used for the CSS styling.

  The application uses Redux. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger. 

  If you'd like, download the Redux Chrome Extension for Google Chrome Browser.
